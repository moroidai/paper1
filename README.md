# Overview of the report
In this paper, I examined time and locational trend of bicycle thefts in Toronto. The result shows that most of the cases are concentrated on the specific 10 neighborhoods, there are less cases in winter and weekends. It may implie that Toronto Police Service should keep in mind the result when strengthening the security of the city."
